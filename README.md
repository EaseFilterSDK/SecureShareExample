# Secure-Share-Example
 A C# secure file sharing with DRM example was implemented with the Transparent File Encryption and Control Filter Driver SDK. The shared file was encrypted with a unique 256-bits key, store the file access policies in a central server, share the encrypted files with fully control. You can grant, revoke or expire the file access at any time, even after the file has been shared. You can add or remove the authorized users, processes and computers at any time. Your application can seamlessly access the encrypted file without any change. The AssureFiles secure agent is integrated with the encryption filter driver, it can decrypt the file in memory transparently if your application is authorized to access the file.

Safeguard file sharing without boundaries

The secure file sharing combines AES 256-bit encryption with digital rights management to give businesses persistent control over all stages of its life, enables employees to share files with anyone, via any method, without compromising business data or risking liability from data loss.

Dynamically control file access

The secure file sharing solution helps organizations prevent data breaches caused by internal and external threats by enhancing access control to critical business applications and data. It integrates DRM policy with leading enterprise and cloud applications to provide access control, data protection, and activity monitoring and reporting.

Keep tracking and auditing to the shared files

With the complete file access live tracking report, you can monitor who, when and where files are being accessed with the user and process information, computer identities and geo-location, also know all the unauthorized user information when unauthorized attempts are made and you can proactively block data leakage.
